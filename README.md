## Overview
Libft is my first coding project at 42 School. This project aims to recreate various standard C library functions as well as additional utility functions that I found useful during my curriculum at 42. 

## Skills Developed
- C programming
- Deep understanding of memory allocation and management
- Linked List Manipulation
- Implementation of basic data structures and algorithms
- Code optimization for efficiency and readability

## Key Features
- Implementation of standard libc functions

## Installation and Usage

- git clone https://github.com/Darrens24/Libft.git
- make
- make bonus

In your .c file :
```c
#include libft.h
```
Then compile, linking the library with your project :
```bash
gcc -o your_project your_source_file.c -L./ -lft
```
